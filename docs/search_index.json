Bailey 2021-02-14 Chapter 1 Prerequisites This book provides an introductory course in R programming. It is primarily designed for wet lab biologists who are interested in developing core skills in the R programming language and who would like to analyze their own RNAseq data! 1.1 Installing R and RStudio To complete this course you will need to install R and RStudio on your local machine. Detailed instructions on how to install R and RStudio are provided in “Hands-on programming with R”. Please make sure that R Version &gt;=3.6.1 is installed on your local machine. Hands-on programming with R is an excellent open source reference for learning the basics of R and can be used as a companion to this course. Please also find additional open source learning resources below that can be used as companions to this course. RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management. Figure 1.1: The RStudio IDE for R. 1.2 Installing R and Bioconductor packages CRAN (the Comprehensive R Archive Network) is a repository of packages for R, and it is mirrored on many servers around the world. It is the default repository system used by R. You can install a package from CRAN by using install.packages(). To install ggplot2 use: install.packages(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) If you are prompted to select a download mirror use the first choice, https://cloud.r-project.org/ You can also install multiple packages at once by passing the function a vector of package names: install.packages(c(&quot;ggplot2&quot;, &quot;tidyverse&quot;)) Once you have R/RStudio up and running please also install Bioconductor. Bioconductor is a repository of R packages for analyzing genomic data! Bioconductor can be installed easily using the following script: if (!requireNamespace(&quot;BiocManager&quot;, quietly = TRUE)) install.packages(&quot;BiocManager&quot;) BiocManager::install(version = &quot;3.12&quot;) Individual packages of interest can then be installed as follows: BiocManager::install(&quot;DESeq2&quot;) Multiple packages of interest can be installed as follows: BiocManager::install(c(&quot;DESeq2&quot;, &quot;ggpubr&quot;, &quot;ComplexHeatmap&quot;, &quot;circlize&quot;, &quot;clusterProfiler&quot;)) Each Bioconductor package contains at least one vignette, a document that provides a task-oriented description of package functionality. Vignettes contain executable examples and are intended to be used interactively. You can access the PDF version of a vignette for any installed package from inside R using the browseVignettes() function. To view documentation about the DESeq2 package you can use the following R function: browseVignettes(&quot;DESeq2&quot;) 1.3 Learning resources There are a multitude of learning resources for the R programming language. Here are just a few noteworthy examples that are entirely open source!!! Wim P. Krijnen (2009) Applied Statistics for Bioinformatics using R R &amp; Bioconductor Manual Hands-on programming with R R for Data Science R Graphics Cookbook 2nd Edition The book is written in RMarkdown with bookdown. "],["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction 2.1 Course outline", " Chapter 2 Introduction 2.1 Course outline The course is divided into 2 parts. PART 1 will teach you the basics of R programming, computational statistics and its application in solving real world biological problems. PART 2 will teach you how to analyse RNAseq data and will provide informatic workflows that you can use in your current research. This course is extremely condensed and you are not expected to complete all tasks before or during the 3 day meeting. We will work through coded examples together. Additional tutorials may be scheduled after meeting close, if ESRs feel that this is necessary! 2.1.1 PART 1 PART 1 is provided in a separate workbook Applications of Computational Statistics. Students are encouraged to at least go through PART 1 before the commencement of the course. By the end of PART 1, you should be able to: Understand basic statistical concepts Perform statistical tests to answer simple to more complex biological questions Mine and explore biological data sets Process microarray data and perform statistical analysis Be able to use the R statistical programming language The following topics are covered in PART 1: Data description Visualizing distributions Measures of central tendency and variability Q-Q plot Boxplots Correlation measures Probability distribution Probability distribution on discrete random variables (binomial, Poisson) Probability distribution on continuous random variables (normal, z, t-, chi-squared, F) Statistical tests Hypothesis testing Statistical tests with continuous variables one sample, two samples, equal and unequal variances F-test and ANOVA Statistical tests with categorical variables Multiple testing Clustering distance definition hierarchical clustering k-means SOM Principal component analysis Analysis of microarray data normalization transformation statistical tests 2.1.1.1 Practicals Practical workbooks are also provided: Programming with Applications in R: an introduction Programming with Applications in Bioconductor: an introduction Data resources used for the Practicals are provided below: Comprehensive molecular portraits of human breast tumours Breast Cancer dataset (eSet.RData) AML dataset (Golub.RData) Practicals P0.1 and P0.2 test R programming basics. Practicals P1 to P7 provide details on how one can apply descriptive statistics to the analysis of transcriptomic data. P1 to P5.3 include exercises as part of assignments A1 and A3 The following topics are covered in the practical component of PART 1: P0.1. Introduction to R + Getting started + Vectors + Matrices P0.2. Intro to R continued + Lists + Data frames + Factors and tables P1. Graphical outputs P2. Statistical tests P3. Clustering P4. PCA P5. Analysis of microarray data 1/3 P6. Analysis of microarray data 2/3 P7. Analysis of microarray data 3/3 2.1.1.2 Assessment Students are encouraged to complete or at least go through the assignments before the commencement of the course. Assignments A1 and A3 are provided below. We will work through the assignment corrections on Day 3. Assignments Assignment 1 Assessing R skills &amp; interpretation of statistical tests - Starts in P1 (covers up to P3) Assignment 2 (Optional): Review and explanation of statistical analysis from a scientific article of the student’s choice . The student should choose a recently published scientific article and explain the aim of the study and how the statistical analyses were performed. Assignment 3 Assessing statistical analyses using data described in Comprehensive molecular portraits of human breast tumours. This assignment will be broken into different exercises covering the content of the pracs P4 to P8 and will be handed at each prac. Starts in P4 (covers up to P8) 2.1.2 PART 2 This part of the course will provide steps for the analysis of RNASeq data. To bring this part of the course into real world focus we will re-analyse RNAseq data published in Brunton et al. HNF4A and GATA6 Loss Reveals Therapeutically Actionable Subtypes in Pancreatic Cancer. Cell Reports 2020 Students should have read Brunton et al and be familiar with the analyses performed before therein the start of the course. PART 2 of this course will be delivered live. We will work through the coded examples together! By the end of PART 2, you should be able to: Use the nf-core/rnaseq bioinformatic workflow to map raw RNAseq reads, assess RNAseq QC and generate count files for downstream analysis Perform PCA/Hierarchical clustering of normalized RNAseq data Perform Differential Gene Expression analysis Generate publication quality heatmaps and statistical plots Perform Gene Set Enrichment analysis to identify significantly enriched biological pathways Subtype PDAC using pre-defined transcriptional signatures "]]
